      description: "Create a short-lived bearer token for a parent user on a child account, using the `euuid` of that child account. In the context of the API, a parent user on a child account is referred to as a \"proxy user.\" When Akamai provisions your parent-child account environment, a proxy user is automatically set in the child account. It follows a specific naming convention:\n\n    <Parent account `company` name>_<SHA256 hash of parent `company` name and child account `euuid`>\n\n__Note__. The variables above use only the first 15 and 16 characters of these values, respectively.\n\nThe token lets a parent account run API operations through the proxy user, as if they are a child user in the child account.\n\nThese points apply to the use of this operation:\n\n- To create a token, a parent account user needs the `child_account_access` grant. This lets them use the proxy user on the child account. You can run [List a user's grants](ref:get-user-grants) on a parent account user to check its `child_account_access` setting. To add this access, you can [update](ref:put-user-grants) the parent account user.\n\n- The created token inherits the permissions of the proxy user. It will never have less.\n\n- The API returns the raw token in the response. You can't get it again, so be sure to store it.\n\nExample workflow:\n\n1. [List child accounts](ref:get-child-accounts) and store the `euuid` for the applicable one.\n2. Run this operation and store the `token` that's created for the proxy user.\n3. As a parent account user with access to the proxy user in the child account, use this `token` to authenticate API operations, as if you were a child user.\n\n\n<<LB>>\n\n```Text CLI\nlinode-cli child-account create A1BC2DEF-34GH-567I-J890KLMN12O34P56\n\n<https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cli/get-started/>\n```\n```Text OAuth scopes\nchild_account:read_write\n\n<https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth>\n```"

        __Parent and child accounts__


        In a [parent and child account](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/parent-child-accounts/) environment, the following apply:


        - No child account user can modify the `account_access` grant for the child account parent user (proxy user).


        - An unrestricted child account user can configure all other grants for the proxy user, via `global` object.


        - An unrestricted child account user can enable the `account_access` grant for other child account users. However, enabled child users are still subject to child user restrictions--they can''t perform write operations for any billing or account information.

        Restore a backup to a Managed MySQL Database on your Account.


        Requires `read_write` access to the Database.


        The Database must have an `active`, `degraded`, or `failed` status to perform this operation.


        __Note__. Restoring from a backup will erase all existing data on the database instance and replace it with backup data.


        __Note__. Currently, restoring a backup after resetting Managed Database credentials results in a failed cluster. Please contact Customer Support if this occurs.

        Apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed MySQL Database. This function runs during regular maintenance windows, which are configurable with the [Update a managed MySQL database](ref:put-databases-mysql-instance) operation.


        Requires `read_write` access to the Database.


        The Database must have an `active` status to perform this operation.


        __Note__


        - If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance. Consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.


        - __The database software is not updated automatically.__ To upgrade to a new database engine version, consider deploying a new Managed Database with your preferred version. You can then [migrate your databases](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/databases/managed-databases/guides/migrate-mysql/) from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.

Up to seven backups are automatically stored for each Managed Database, providing restore points for each day of the past week.\n\nAll Managed Databases include automatic patch updates, which apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed PostgreSQL Database during configurable maintenance windows.\n\n- If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance window when any updates occur. It's recommended that you adjust this window to match a time that will be the least disruptive for your application and users. You may also want to consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.\n\n- __The database software is not updated automatically.__ To upgrade to a new database engine version, consider deploying a new Managed Database with your preferred version.

        Restore a backup to a Managed PostgreSQL Database on your Account.


        Requires `read_write` access to the Database.


        The Database must have an `active`, `degraded`, or `failed` status to perform this operation.


        __Note__. Restoring from a backup will erase all existing data on the database instance and replace it with backup data.


        __Note__. Currently, restoring a backup after resetting Managed Database credentials results in a failed cluster. Please contact Customer Support if this occurs.

        Apply security patches and updates to the underlying operating system of the Managed PostgreSQL Database. This function runs during regular maintenance windows, which are configurable with the [Update a managed PostgreSQL database](ref:put-databases-postgre-sql-instance) operation.


        Requires `read_write` access to the Database.


        The Database must have an `active` status to perform this operation.


        __Note__


        - If your database cluster is configured with a single node, you will experience downtime during this maintenance. Consider upgrading to a high availability plan to avoid any downtime due to maintenance.


        - __The database software is not updated automatically.__ To upgrade to a new database engine version, consider deploying a new Managed Database with your preferred version. You can then migrate your databases from the original Managed Database cluster to the new one.

                      - `cloud-init`. The image supports the cloud-init multi-distribution method with our [Metadata service](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/#troubleshoot-metadata-and-cloud-init). This only applies to public images.


                      - `distributed-sites`. Whether the image can be used in distributed compute regions. Compared to a core compute region, distributed compute regions offer limited functionality, but they''re globally distributed. Your image can be geographically closer to you, potentially letting you deploy it quicker.

                      - `cloud-init`. The image supports the cloud-init multi-distribution method with our [Metadata service](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/#troubleshoot-metadata-and-cloud-init). This only applies to public images.


                      - `distributed-sites`. Whether the image can be used in distributed compute regions. Compared to a core compute region, distributed compute regions offer limited functionality, but they''re globally distributed. Your image can be geographically closer to you, potentially letting you deploy it quicker.

                      - `cloud-init`. The image supports the cloud-init multi-distribution method with our [Metadata service](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/#troubleshoot-metadata-and-cloud-init). This only applies to public images.


                      - `distributed-sites`. Whether the image can be used in distributed compute regions. Compared to a core compute region, distributed compute regions offer limited functionality, but they''re globally distributed. Your image can be geographically closer to you, potentially letting you deploy it quicker.

Creating a new Linode will incur a charge on your Account.\n\nLinodes can be created using one of the available Types. Run [List Linode types](ref:get-linode-types) to get more information about each Type's specs and cost.\n\nLinodes can be created in any one of our available Regions, which are accessible from the [List regions](ref:get-regions) operation.\n\nIn an effort to fight spam, Linode restricts outbound connections on ports 25, 465, and 587 on all Linodes for new accounts created after November 5th, 2019. For more information, see our guide on [Running a Mail Server](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/running-a-mail-server/).\n\n__Important__. You must be an unrestricted User in order to add or modify tags on Linodes.\n\nLinodes can be created in a number of ways:\n\n- Using a Linode Public Image distribution or a Private Image you created based on another Linode.\n\n  - Run the [List images](ref:get-images) operation with authentication to view all available Images.\n\n  - The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`.\n  - A default config with two Disks, one being a 512 swap disk, is created.\n    - `swap_size` can be used to customize the swap disk size.\n  - Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.\n  - It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.\n  - You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.\n    - These users must have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first. See the [Add an SSH key](ref:post-add-ssh-key)) operation for more information.\n\n- Using cloud-init with [Metadata](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/).\n  - Automate system configuration and software installation by providing a base-64 encoded [cloud-config](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata-cloud-config/) file.\n  - Requires a compatible Image. You can determine compatible Images by checking for `cloud-init` under `capabilities` when running [List images](ref:get-images).\n  - Requires a compatible Region.  You can determine compatible Regions by checking for `Metadata` under `capabilities` when running [List regions](ref:get-regions).\n\n- Using a StackScript.\n\n  - Run [List StackScripts](ref:get-stack-scripts) for a list of available StackScripts.\n  - The Linode will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`.\n  - Requires a compatible Image to be supplied.\n    - Run [Get a StackScript](ref:get-stack-script) for compatible Images.\n  - Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.\n  - It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.\n  - You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.\n    - These users must have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first. See [Add an SSH key](ref:post-add-ssh-key) for more information.\n\n- Using one of your other Linode's backups.\n  - You must create a Linode large enough to accommodate the Backup's size.\n  - The Disks and Config will match that of the Linode that was backed up.\n  - The `root_pass` will match that of the Linode that was backed up.\n\n- Attached to a private VLAN.\n  - Review the `interfaces` property of the [Request Body Schema](ref:post-linode-instance) for details.\n  - For more information, see our guide on [Getting Started with VLANs](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/get-started/).\n\n- Create an empty Linode.\n  - The Linode will remain `offline` and must be manually started.\n    - Run [Boot a Linode](ref:post-boot-linode-instance).\n  - Disks and Configs must be created manually.\n  - This is only recommended for advanced use cases.\n\n\n<<LB>>\n\n```Text CLI\nlinode-cli linodes create \\\n  --label linode123 \\\n  --root_pass aComplex@Password \\\n  --booted true \\\n  --stackscript_id 10079 \\\n  --stackscript_data '{\"gh_username\": \"linode\"}' \\\n  --region us-east \\\n  --disk_encryption enabled\\\n  --placement_group.id 528 \\\n  --type g6-standard-2 \\\n  --authorized_keys \"ssh-rsa AAAA_valid_public_ssh_key_123456785== user@their-computer\" \\\n  --authorized_users \"myUser\" \\\n  --authorized_users \"secondaryUser\" \\\n  --metadata.user_data \"I2Nsb3VkLWNvbmZpZw==\" \\\n  --firewall_id 9000\n\n<https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cli/get-started/>\n```\n```Text OAuth scopes\nlinodes:read_write\n\n<https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth>\n```"

      description: "Restores a Linode's Backup to the specified Linode.\n\nThe following conditions apply:\n\n  - Backups may not be restored across Regions.\n  - Only successfully completed Backups that are not undergoing maintenance can be restored.\n  - The Linode that the Backup is being restored to must not itself be in the process of creating a Backup.\n\n__Note__. When you restore a backup, the restored disk is assigned the same [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) as the original disk. In most cases, this is acceptable and does not cause issues. However, if you attempt to mount both the original disk and the corresponding restore disk at the same time (by assigning them both to devices in your Configuration Profile's __Block Device Assignment__), you will encounter a UUID \"collision\".\n\nWhen this happens, the system selects, and mounts, only one of the disks at random. This is due to both disks sharing the same UUID, and your instance _may fail to boot_ since it will not be clear which disk is root. If your system does boot, you will not see any immediate indication if you are booted into the restored disk or the original disk, and you will be unable to access both disks at the same time.\n\nTo avoid this, we recommend only restoring a backup to the same Compute Instance if you do not intend on mounting them at the same time or are comfortable modifying UUIDs. If you need access to files on both the original disk and the restored disk simultaneously (such as needing to copy files between them), we suggest either restoring the backup to a separate Compute Instance or [creating](ref:post-linode-instance) a new Compute Instance with the desired `backup_id`.\n\nTo learn more about block device assignments and viewing your disks' UUIDs, see our guide on [Configuration Profiles](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/configuration-profiles/#block-device-assignment).\n\n__Note__. Backups are not encrypted even when they are taken from an encrypted disk. When a backup is restored, and if encryption is enabled, the data stored on the disk is encrypted again.\n\n\n<<LB>>\n\n```Text CLI\nlinode-cli linodes backup-restore 123 123456 \\\n  --linode_id 234 \\\n  --overwrite true\n\n<https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cli/get-started/>\n```\n```Text OAuth scopes\nlinodes:read_write\n\n<https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth>\n```"

If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

                                  - Required.

                                  - Must be unique among the Linode''s Interfaces (a Linode cannot be attached to the same VLAN multiple times).

                                  - Can only contain ASCII letters, numbers, and hyphens (`-`). You can''t use two consecutive hyphens (`--`).

                                  - If the VLAN label is new, a VLAN is created. Up to 10 VLANs can be created in each data center region. To view your active VLANs, run the [List VLANs](ref:get-vlans) operation.


                                  For `public` purpose Interfaces:


                                  - In requests, must be an empty string (`""`) or `null` if included.

                                  - In responses, always returns `null`.


                                  For `vpc` purpose Interfaces:


                                  - In requests, must be an empty string (`""`) or `null` if included.

                                  - In responses, always returns `null`.'

                      - Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Run the [List regions](ref:get-regions) operation to view the capabilities of data center regions. If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

                      - See the [VLANs Overview](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications) guide to view additional specifications and limitations.'

                      - Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Run the [List regions](ref:get-regions) operation to view the capabilities of data center regions. If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

                      - See the [VLANs Overview](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications) guide to view additional specifications and limitations.'

If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

                    - Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Run the [List regions](ref:get-regions) operation to view the capabilities of data center regions. If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

                    - See the [VLANs Overview](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications) guide to view additional specifications and limitations.'

                      - Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Run the [List regions](ref:get-regions) operation to view the capabilities of data center regions. If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

                      - See the [VLANs Overview](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications) guide to view additional specifications and limitations.'

If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.

      description: "Rebuilds a Linode you have the `read_write` permission to modify.\n\nA rebuild will first shut down the Linode, delete all disks and configs on the Linode, and then deploy a new `image` to the Linode with the given attributes. Additionally:\n\n  - Requires an `image` be supplied.\n  - Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for the root User's Account.\n  - It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.\n  - Linodes utilizing Metadata (`\"has_user_data\": true`) should include `metadata.user_data` in the rebuild request to continue using the service.\n\nDuring a rebuild, you can `enable` or `disable` local disk encryption. If disk encryption is not included in the request, the previous `disk_encryption` value is used. Disk encryption cannot be disabled if the compute instance is attached to a LKE nodepool.\n\nYou also have the option to resize the Linode to a different plan by including the `type` parameter with your request. Note that resizing involves migrating the Linode to a new hardware host, while rebuilding without resizing maintains the same hardware host. Resizing also requires significantly more time for completion of this operation. The following additional conditions apply:\n\n  - The Linode must not have a pending migration.\n  - Your Account cannot have an outstanding balance.\n  - The Linode must not have more disk allocation than the new Type allows.\n    - In that situation, you must first delete or resize the disk to be smaller.\n\n\n<<LB>>\n\n```Text CLI\nlinode-cli linodes rebuild 123 \\\n  --image \"linode/debian9\" \\\n  --root_pass aComplex@Password \\\n  --disk_encryption disabled \\\n  --authorized_keys \"ssh-rsa AAAA_valid_public_ssh_key_123456785== user@their-computer\" \\\n  --authorized_users \"myUsername\" \\\n  --authorized_users \"secondaryUsername\" \\\n  --booted true \\\n  --stackscript_id 10079 \\\n  --stackscript_data '{\"gh_username\": \"linode\"}' \\\n  --type \"g6-standard-2\" \\\n  --metadata.userdata \"I2Nsb3VkLWNvbmZpZw==\"\n\n<https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cli/get-started/>\n```\n```Text OAuth scopes\nlinodes:read_write\n\n<https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth>\n```"

        IP sharing allows IP address reassignment (also referred to as IP failover) from one Linode to another if the primary Linode becomes unresponsive. This means that requests to the primary Linode''s IP address can be automatically rerouted to secondary Linodes at the configured shared IP addresses.


        IP failover requires configuration of a failover service (such as [Keepalived](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/ip-failover-keepalived)) within the internal system of the primary Linode.

        VLANs are created and attached to Linodes by using the `interfaces` property for the following operations:


        - [Create a Linode](ref:post-linode-instance)

        - [Create a config profile](ref:post-add-linode-config)

        - [Update a config profile](ref:put-linode-config)


        There are several ways to detach a VLAN from a Linode:


        - [Update](ref:put-linode-config) the active Configuration Profile to remove the VLAN Interface, then [reboot](ref:post-reboot-linode-instance) the Linode.

        - [Create a config profile](ref:post-add-linode-config) without the VLAN Interface, then [reboot](ref:post-reboot-linode-instance) the Linode into the new Configuration Profile.

        - [Delete](ref:delete-linode-instance) the Linode.


        __Note__. Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Run the [List regions](ref:get-regions) operation to view the capabilities of data center regions. If a VLAN is attached to your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center, the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or contact support.


        __Note__. See the [VLANs Overview](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications) to view additional specifications and limitations.

Nodes are specific to NodeBalancer Configs, and serve traffic over their private IP.  If the same Linode is serving traffic for more than one port on the same NodeBalancer, one NodeBalancer Node is required for each config (port) it should serve requests on.  For example, if you have four backends, and each should response to both HTTP and HTTPS requests, you will need two NodeBalancerConfigs (port 80 and port 443) and four backends each - one for each of the Linodes serving requests for that port.

      description: "Provisions a new Object Storage key for authenticating to the Object Storage S3 API. A successful request triggers an `obj_access_key_create` [event](ref:get-events).\n\n> \U0001F4D8\n>\n> Accounts with negative balances can't access this operation.\n\n**The `regions` and `region` parameters**\n\nWhen creating an Object Storage key, specify one or more data centers ([regions](ref:get-regions)) where you want to create and manage Object Storage buckets.\n\n- **The `regions` array**. Populate it with `regionId` values. The resulting Object Storage key grants access to list and create new buckets in these regions. This *doesn't* give access to manage content in these buckets. To address this, you can:\n\n  - Use the `bucket_access` array instead to grant management access, per bucket.\n\n  - Use [bucket policies](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/bucket-policies/) to change the access for this key.\n\n- **The `bucket_access` array**. This optional array lets you set up limited keys. Include individual objects naming a `regionId`, the target `bucket_name`, and the `permissions` for the Object Storage key. Use the resulting key to manage content in the `bucket_name`, based on the permission level set. You can also use the key to create new buckets in the named region. However, the key doesn't have access to manage content in the newly created bucket. You can grant it this access using [bucket policies](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/bucket-policies/).\n\n- **Combine the two to apply varying levels of access in the key**. For example, set `regions` to `us-west` to give the key bucket list and create access in that region. Then, set up the `bucket_access` array to give access to a specific `bucket_name` in the `us-east` region. The key has access to manage content in that `bucket_name` and list and create buckets in the `us-east` region, too. If you include the same region in both, the settings applied in the `bucket_access` array take precedence. For example, assume you include `us-east` in the `regions` array, expecting to only give bucket list and creation access to that region. If you also set `us-east` as a `region` in the `bucket_access` array, the Object Storage key gives access to manage content in the specified `bucket_name`, and lets you list and create buckets in that region.\n\n**The `cluster` parameter (legacy)**\n\nFor backward compatibility, include the `cluster` parameter to create an Object Storage key. Use the `clusterId` equivalent (us-west-1) instead of the `regionId` (us-west). Leave the `regions` array out. If including the `bucket_access` array to limit access, omit `region` from each object. Use the resulting key in clusters in all supported regions.\n\n> \U0001F4D8\n>\n> While the API supports this method, you should use the `regions` parameters, instead.\n\n- **Unlimited access**. Omit the `bucket_access` array. The Object Storage key has unlimited cluster access to all buckets, with all permissions.\n\n- **Limited access**. Include the `bucket_access` array. Set the target `bucket_name` and the level of `permissions` for access to that bucket. Use the resulting key to manage content in the named bucket. A limited Object Storage key can [list all buckets](ref:get-object-storage-buckets) and [create a new bucket](ref:post-object-storage-bucket). However, you can't use the key to perform any actions on a bucket, unless the key has access to it. You can use [bucket policies](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/bucket-policies/) to modify a key's access.\n\n\n<<LB>>\n\n```Text CLI\nlinode-cli object-storage keys-create \\\n  --label \"my-object-storage-key\" \\\n  --bucket_access '[{\"region\": \"ap-south\", \"bucket_name\": \"bucket-example-1\", \"permissions\": \"read_write\" }]'\n\n<https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cli/get-started/>\n```\n```Text OAuth scopes\nobject_storage:read_write\n\n<https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-started#oauth>\n```"

        - If your placement group is non-compliant, you can''t delete it. You need to wait for our help to bring it [compliant](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/placement-groups/#non-compliance-precedence).
